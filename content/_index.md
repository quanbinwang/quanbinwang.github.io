subtitle: "Ph.D. in public administration"
description: "Hi, welcome to my site. I am a faculty member of the Zhou Enlai School of Government, Nankai University. My official website is here. 

My research interests include government transparency, digital governance, and coproduction. My research primarily focuses on why and how government responds to information requests, and how information interventions affect citizen coproduction in the digital platform.

I obtained my Ph.D. in public administration at the School of International and Public Affairs, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am extraordinarily honored and grateful to have Professor Bo Fan as my adviser. He had supported and guided me in my academic progress."
